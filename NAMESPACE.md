## NAMESPACE

File in R packages that export your functions in your package for other people to use.

You used to have to write this by hand, but now it is autogenerated through `devtools::document` which uses Roxygen2.


#### export

* `export(function_name)` makes a function publicly available to users of the package.


#### import

* `importFrom(package_name, function_name)` imports a particular function from a particular package.
* `import(package_name)` imports all functions from a particular package.


#### S3Method

* Exports methods from S3 classes.  E.g., `S3method(as.col_spec, character)` exports the `as.col_spec.character` method.  (This is another example of how dots in function names are bad.)


#### exportClasses, importClassesFrom

* Imports / Exports S4 methods.


#### useDynLib

* Imports a function from C.
